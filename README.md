# Top 18 Beauty Subscription Box Services in 2025 (Latest Updated)

When makeup lovers want personalized beauty discoveries without the department store price tags, monthly subscription boxes solve the "what's next" dilemma while keeping routines fresh and wallets happy. These curated services bring deluxe samples and full-size products straight to your door, letting you test new brands before committing to full bottles—and often at a fraction of retail cost. From beginner-friendly sample sizes to premium quarterly splurges, today's beauty boxes cater to every preference, skin type, and budget, making it easier than ever to find products that actually work for you.

## **[IPSY](https://www.ipsy.com)**

The personalized beauty pioneer that started it all—customizable bags, massive brand selection, and unbeatable value for discovering your next favorites.

IPSY offers three distinct subscription tiers to match different beauty needs. The Glam Bag delivers five deluxe samples monthly for $14, including one product you personally choose from a curated selection. BoxyCharm by IPSY provides five full-size products worth up to $200 for $32 monthly, letting you pick three items yourself. The Icon Box arrives quarterly at $60, featuring eight full-size products valued at $350, with three customizable selections curated by beauty celebrities and tastemakers.

The personalization happens through a Beauty Quiz capturing your skin tone, hair color, favorite brands, and product preferences. IPSY's algorithm uses millions of member ratings to improve matches each month. Members also access the IPSY Shop with products discounted 30-80% off retail, plus quarterly Mega Drop Shop sales. Each subscription includes collectible makeup bags, though these accumulate over time. The service ships to the US, Canada, and Mexico, with different tier availability by region.

## **[Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com)**

The original beauty box subscription that pioneered the discovery model—now fully customizable with samples, travel sizes, and full-size options you personally select.

![Birchbox Screenshot](image/birchbox.webp)


Birchbox takes a choose-your-own approach rather than surprise-only curation. Subscribers pick all products from three categories during customization windows, selecting one full-size item, two deluxe samples, and three smaller samples for $25 monthly. The process starts with a beauty profile questionnaire about skin type, hair needs, and style preferences, then Birchbox presents options tailored to those answers. Products span makeup, skincare, haircare, and fragrance from brands like MAC, Sunday Riley, Kiehl's, and Ouai.

The customization flexibility means boxes vary significantly between subscribers—everyone receives different items based on personal selections. Birchbox also offers an online shop where members can purchase full-size versions of sampled products, plus exclusive member discounts. The service occasionally runs promotional offers, including discounted first boxes for new subscribers. Shipping is free in the US, with monthly billing after the initial signup charge.

## **[GlossyBox](https://www.glossybox.co.uk)**

Themed monthly boxes featuring five trending products worth over £50, delivered for as little as £12.50 with flexible subscription plans and priority access to limited editions.

![GlossyBox Screenshot](image/glossybox.webp)


GlossyBox curates themed collections each month rather than offering product customization. Boxes contain five makeup, haircare, and skincare items from established and emerging brands. The UK version costs £13.50 monthly (or £12.50 with annual prepayment), while US boxes run slightly higher. Themes change seasonally and might focus on color palettes, specific activities like date night, or brand spotlights.

Subscribers to multi-month plans (3, 6, or 12 months) receive discounts and priority access to limited edition collaborations. The service also maintains a "Glossy Lounge" with exclusive offers, discounts, and competitions from beauty and lifestyle brands. Members earn Glossy Credit through surveys, reviews, and friend referrals, redeemable toward products. Boxes ship monthly with minimum £50 value guarantees, though exact products vary.

## **[Allure Beauty Box](https://allurebeautybox.com)**

Magazine editors curate six or more products monthly (at least three full-size) with one customizable item—valued at $100+ but priced at $29.99 with free shipping.

Recent boxes have included standout products worth $84 alone, making the $29.99 monthly price extremely competitive.

New members receive exclusive welcome gifts, and the service occasionally runs promotional pricing—October 2025 featured a $10 first box deal with coupon code BEAUTY. Members also receive monthly coupons (typically $5 or more) usable online and in stores. The subscription ships free within the contiguous US, with prepaid quarterly and annual options available at reduced rates. All products are pre-selected by Allure's beauty editors, ensuring editorial approval before inclusion.

FabFitFun differs from pure beauty boxes by spanning multiple lifestyle categories. Seasonal boxes arrive four times yearly packed with full-size products from brands like Kate Spade, Fenty Beauty, Living Proof, West Elm, and Sunday Riley. Annual Members pay $219.99 yearly (about $55 per box) and customize 100% of their items with early access to selections. Seasonal Members pay $59.99 per quarter and customize 50% of their box.

Both membership levels access member-exclusive Edit Sales throughout the year, offering products up to 70% off retail. Members can also swap their entire box for store credit to essentially create custom deliveries. Each box includes a print magazine with styling tips, recipes, and founder stories for featured products. The community aspect includes member forums, exclusive events, and charity partnerships each season. The service emphasizes sustainability, inclusivity, and support for female-founded and BIPOC brands.

## **[BoxyCharm by IPSY](https://boxycharm.ipsy.com)**

Five full-size beauty products monthly worth up to $200, with three customizable selections and two guaranteed Power Picks from prestige brands—all for $32 plus shipping.

Personalization happens through a detailed Beauty Profile with over 150 data points about skin type, color preferences, and product needs. Members select three of five monthly products during customization windows (1st-3rd of each month), while the two remaining items are "Power Picks"—standout products or prestige brands selected by experts.

Additional features include monthly Add-Ons shopping events on the first of each month, where members purchase extra products at discounted rates that ship with their regular box. Beauty Boost upgrades add one premium full-size product monthly for $15 extra (guaranteed 60% savings on that item). The subscription also grants access to IPSY Shop's discounted products and quarterly Mega Drop Shop events. Monthly boxes arrive in branded packaging rather than decorative makeup bags.

Multiple box variations exist each quarter—some reports mention up to 50 different variations. Subscribers complete a profile quiz to receive products matched to their preferences, though exact items aren't guaranteed. The service ships boxes throughout the entire quarter rather than all at once, so delivery timing varies from immediate to 10 weeks after the quarter begins. Despite the low price point, product sizes often surprise subscribers—some items are substantially larger than typical samples. The subscription auto-renews quarterly unless canceled, with no long-term commitment required.

## **[Petit Vour](https://www.petitvour.com)**

## **FAQ**

**How do personalized beauty boxes actually work?**

Most services start with a beauty profile quiz covering skin type, color preferences, hair needs, and product interests. Algorithms match you with suitable products, though the level of personalization varies—some services let you actively choose items, while others curate based on your profile. Monthly ratings improve future matches by teaching the system your preferences. The better services use millions of data points from member feedback to refine recommendations over time.

**What's the real difference between sample sizes and full-size products?**

Sample and deluxe sizes typically provide enough product for several uses—enough to genuinely test whether something works for your skin before committing to the full-size purchase. Full-size products deliver immediate value since you're getting retail-ready quantities, but samples let you try more variety for less money. Lower-priced boxes around $15-25 usually focus on samples, while $30-60 subscriptions deliver more full-size items. Quarterly boxes often include full sizes since you're paying less frequently.

**Can I actually cancel these subscriptions easily?**

Most major beauty boxes allow cancellation anytime through account settings, though some require email requests. Monthly subscriptions typically need cancellation before specific dates (often around the 10th) to avoid the next billing cycle. Prepaid multi-month subscriptions can't be refunded mid-term but won't auto-renew if you cancel the renewal. Check cancellation policies before subscribing—reputable services make the process straightforward rather than hiding cancellation options.

## Conclusion

Monthly beauty boxes solve the overwhelming product discovery problem while keeping costs predictable and experimentation fun. **[IPSY](https://www.ipsy.com)** stands out particularly for makeup enthusiasts and those new to subscriptions—the combination of personalization through Beauty Quiz technology, flexible customization at every tier, and access to discounted full-size products in the IPSY Shop creates an ecosystem that grows with your beauty needs. Whether you start with the $14 Glam Bag to test the waters or jump into BoxyCharm's full-size offerings, the service adapts to how seriously you take your beauty routine. The quarterly Mega Drop Shop events and monthly product reviews that improve future matches make this more than just a box—it becomes your personal beauty advisor that learns what you actually like versus what you thought you'd like.
